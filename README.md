# React TypeScript Samples

This repository contains sample code demonstrating various React and TypeScript concepts through practical examples. Each sample is organised in its own directory and includes complete, working code that you can run and learn from.

## Samples

### Single App Instance
Located in the `single-app-instance` directory, this sample demonstrates:
- Setting up a React application with TypeScript
- Using Vite as the build tool
- Basic React component structure
- TypeScript type definitions
- Modern React development practices

Each sample is a self-contained React application. To run any sample:

1. Navigate to the sample directory:
   ```bash
   cd <sample-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
